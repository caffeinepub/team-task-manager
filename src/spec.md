# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance the founder dashboard with comprehensive progress overview, task assignment visibility, and enable employees to submit completed work.

**Planned changes:**
- Add overall progress metrics section to founder dashboard showing total tasks, completed tasks, completion percentage, and active projects count
- Create task assignment column/section in founder dashboard displaying assigned employee, task title, project name, completion date, and priority for all tasks
- Restrict employee task view to only show tasks assigned to the logged-in employee
- Add work submission button for employees to mark tasks as complete, updating status and recording submission timestamp

**User-visible outcome:** Founders can view aggregated progress metrics and see all task assignments in one place. Employees can only see their own assigned tasks and submit completed work directly from their task view.
